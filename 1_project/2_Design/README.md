* Digital Temperature sensor Block Diagram:-
*  Microcontroller:
   * It is a high performance , low power controller from microchip.
   * it combines Memory,EEPROM,SRAM,Input/Output Lines,registers and Counters etc.
* Power Supply:
  * It is used to supply the power to the circuit.
* Lcd Display:
  * It is used to print the digital output on the Lcd Display panel.
* Temperature Sensor:
  * It is used to calculate the temperature .
  * It is analog sensor so it will give output as analog output.
* ADC(Analog to Digital Converter):
  * It is used to Convert the signal from analog to digital and gives digital output.
