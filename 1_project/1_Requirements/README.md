* 5W,S and 1H:
  * What: 
    * It is used to measure the temperature.
  * When: 
    * It is used in hospitals for calculating temperature and used in some industries like Microoven         Industries  etc.
  * Who :
    * It is useful for everyone for example people use thermometer while they are suffering from fever and in some utensils also it will be useful.
  * Where: 
    * It is used mainly in hospitals etc
  * Why: 
    * It is used to measure the different types of temperature like body temperature,Room temperature etc
  * How:
    * It is useful for measuring temperature during covid checking, fewer checking etc. We need to turn the machine on and keep in touch with body then it will measure and show how much the temperature is.
